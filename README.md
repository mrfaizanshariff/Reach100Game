Its a game which is to be played by 2 players. Each player gets  the chance to roll the dice and what ever number shows up is added to his score.
If number 1 comes then all the current score will be lost and control will switch to the next user. 
The user can hold their score by clicking on the hold button,this switches the user. Play it as well to get some more idea about this
